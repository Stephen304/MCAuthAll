MCAuthAll
=========

About
-----

MCAuthAll aims to provide a method of authentication that allows non-premium minecraft players to be authenticated with the official minecraft servers using a host file addition while still allowing premium players to play without any modifications or extra effort.

An interesting side effeect of using this system, when using the host file mod, allows non-premium users to play minecraft using official launchers as if they owned minecraft. In fact, those using the cracked launcher will not be able to join unless the server accepts unsecure non-premium players and the cracked launcher is accompanied by a client mod.

Install - Server
----------------

1. Download the latest MCAuthAll and host it on a server that can be accessed by all players and the server.

2. Add this line to the hosts file of the server machine:
`ip.of.your.server session.minecraft.net`

3. Edit the options.php (Coming soon) to your liking. (Full auth mode will require mysql)

Install - Clients
-----------------

* Premium clients can play on the server like normal

* Non-Premium players must use a launcher that is modified to log in to your server

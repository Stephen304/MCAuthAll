MCAuthAll
=========

MCAuthAll aims to provide a method of authentication that allows non-premium minecraft players to be authenticated with the official minecraft servers using a host file addition while still allowing premium players to play without any modifications or extra effort. An interesting side effeect of this system allows non-premium users to play minecraft using official launchers as if they owned minecraft. In fact, those using the cracked launcher will not be able to join unless the server accepts unsecure non-premium players and the cracked launcher is accompanied by a client mod.
